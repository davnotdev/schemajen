# Schemajen

Auto-magically infer language bindings given a JSON schema.

You could have a perfect REST API, but if your users have to manually write POST requests, the experience is ruined.
Bridging client and backend is hard.
This is especially true if your backend is written in a different language from your client.
Schemajen is a tool that makes process almost painless.
